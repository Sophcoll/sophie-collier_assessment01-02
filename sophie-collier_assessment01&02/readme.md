Hi Beshad, 

My second page of HTML is Mexico. The 'Mexico' in the top navigation bar jumps you to the 'Mexico' section on the homepage and from here if you click 'Read Me' it will take you to the 'Mexico' HTML page. 

You will find my Javascript section for Assignment 02 in the 'Eats' section on the 'Mexico' HTML page

Thanks again for teaching the class, it was really great! 

Cheers, 
Sophie
