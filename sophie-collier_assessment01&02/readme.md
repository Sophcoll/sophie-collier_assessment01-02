Hi Beshad, 

My second page of HTML is Mexico. The 'Mexico' in the top navigation bar jumps you to the 'Mexico' section on the homepage and from here if you click 'Read Me' it will take you to the 'Mexico' HTML page. 

You will find my Javascript section for Assignment 02 in the 'Eats' section on the 'Mexico' HTML page.

Please note: I have been struggling with the images in the grid layouts on the Mexico Page, they get stretched when you look at them in a Safari Browser. After a bit of trouble shooting and googling, it seems as though it's because I have specified a the images to have a height and witdth of 100%. If you remove the height and leave the width at 100% they work in Safari but then they don't fit the grid frames well in Chrome (Very frustrating). I have left both the height and width at 100% so it works in Chrome but unsure what I would do to make it work in both sadly.  

Thanks again for teaching the class, it was really great! 

Cheers, 
Sophie
